Finally! As of December 2015 the European Union has settled on the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Since May 2018, the GDPR unifies data privacy laws across Europe.

## Timetable – Data Protection

-   March 2016 – official German version of GDPR
-   April 2016 – consultation process within EU-Council of Ministers, followed by voting in European Parliament
-   May 25th 2018 – new General Data Protection Regulation Goals and Principles goes into effect

The main goals of the new GDPR are the protection of fundamental rights
and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of
personal data and rules relating to the free movement of personal data.

The new law intends to be data protection-friendlier for individuals and
users. Control of personal data will be returned to the citizen. A set of
principles laid out in Article 5 of the GDPR ensures that data shall be:

-   processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation
    to the data subject (**lawfulness**, **fairness** and
    **transparency**);

-   collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not
    further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those
    purposes (**purpose** **limitation**);

-   adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to
    the purposes for which they are processed (**data minimisation**);

-   accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable
    step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate,
    having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are
    erased or rectified without delay (**data** **accuracy**);

-   kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no
    longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal
    data are processed (**storage limitation**);

-   processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the
    personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful
    processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using
    appropriate technical or organisational measures (**integrity and
    confidentiality**).

-   The controller shall be responsible, and be able to demonstrate
    compliance **('accountability')**

Heads up! In terms of responsibility and accountability, company
managers have to prove their compliance to escape liability.

## Financial penalties

One of the significant but very unpleasant changes is that under GDPR,
firms can be fined up to **€20 million** ($28m) or **four percent of
group worldwide turnover**, whichever is greater. Companies are therefore
beginning to fear **insolvency** or even **closure** as a
result of the GDPR penalties that will soon be very real for all businesses.

## Personal data

GDPR applies only in situations involving personal data. Personal
data is understood as any information relating to an identified or
identifiable natural person; an identifiable natural person is one who can be
identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an
identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data,
IP-adress or to one or more factors specific to the physical,
physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of
that natural person.

## Who does it concern?

All companies who are based on EU-ground as resident enterprises.

Non-European countries must also comply with the regulations if:

-   A company has a branch based within the EU, or

-   They process personal data of EU-citizens.
