   A Header of sorts.
</p>

Our competences span the whole software life-cycle, from requirements collection to implementation detail, the full-stack, security, and automation.

## Privacy Conscious? You Don't Have To Compromise

If you want to respect privacy without giving up features and functionality, then our privacy conscious site might be for you.
It is self-contained: it doesn't use 3rd parties, but doesn't compromise on other aspects such as analytics.
It is a synthesis of open-source components for privacy and -of course- a site crafted for you.

What it offers:

- A **self-contained** package down to fonts.
Nothing is fetched from across the Web.
Not video and not fonts.

- **Analytics** that respect privacy but give you insight.

- **Rich media** that doesn't have to compromise privacy.
Use self-hosted video, rather than a 3rd party, to deliver content.

On the technical side:

- CMS: Directus
- CI/CD: Jenkins
- Analytics: Matomo
- Gatsby and React

## Breadth & Depth of Technical Expertise

More often than not we work on multiple fronts.
We provide technical guidance and execution, from requirements collection to implementation detail.
Our competences span the full stack and those of security and automation.

## Our Way

We champion Open Source internally at Port Zero and in our work.
When it comes to architecture and security, the breadth and depth of our technical expertise really finds a home.
We work in the SDN space, the realm of personal data, and logistics to name a few.
Some of our favourite mainstream languages are Go, Python, and JS as well as Haskell, Pharo, and Elixir.
