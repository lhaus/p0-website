We offer System Integration with a focus on **digitization** and **automatization**. Modernizing legacy infrastructure, integrating (manual) workflows and connecting your systems without vendor locking. By always supporting open-source solutions we improve maintainability as well as security.

## Monitoring Systems

We have extensive knowledge about setting up and integrating monitoring systems for your existing or new infrastructure.

- Out of the box, deployed in minutes, fully open source, fully customizable: our monitoring and alerting stack consists of ansible, prometheus, grafana and the alertmanager.
- We integrate into existing monitoring solutions (Nagios, etc).
- We provide debugging and feature extension for existing monitoring solutions.

## Integrating Systems

We know you've got a cronjob that is running a PHP CSV parser that pushes data directly into another system's database somewhere in your infrastructure. We can help!
- We design and implement a modern API to connect your services.
- We can modernize, add features to or debug existing APIs in your infrastructure.
- We can set up a centralized user & rights management concept and system (LDAP + interfaces).

## Administrating Systems

We can also help you with the administration of your existing infrastructure. For example:

- Setting up a CI/CD pipeline.
- Setting up extensible Jitsi servers for your organization.
- Setting up Ansible for managing your infrastructure configuration.
- All things system administration! Configuring failovers or webserservers, upgrading a Linux distribution, ...


## Breadth & Depth of Technical Expertise

We have worked extensively in the following areas, with a multitude of underlying technologies:
Green-field Setups, Maintenance, Feature Extension, Migration, Upgrades, Debugging, Incident Response, Performance Optimizations, HA/Redundant Setups/Recovery, Backups, Automation, System Integration, Trainings


## Our Way

We champion Open Source internally at Port Zero and in our work. We understand ourselves as DevOps, approaching problems and solutions directly in a real-world environment. To bridge between system administration and software development and find the best **integration** between the two.
