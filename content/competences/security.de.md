Uniting a diverse community of expert individuals is a unique strength of our community. Our specific combination of skill sets and fields of expertise enables us to support our customers with what we love to do:

## Security Consulting
We enable our partners to live and practice solid process-oriented Information Security throughout all levels of their organisation. We tackle tricky individual challenges with them, or actively support them as long-term partners with the implementation of processes and frameworks, a milestone of which can be one of the relevant Information Security certifications.

We love to play on our unique strength to bring together a diverse team of highly-skilled specialists to ensure deep contribution in all relevant fields. Management frameworks and certifications in which we have particularly solid implementation experience include _ISO 27000+_, _BSI IT-Grundschutz_, _C5_, _TISAX_ and _PCI DSS_.

## Penetration Testing
Our many years of experience in comprehensive penetration tests of a broad range of customer systems and applications have led to a solid testing methodology and utilization-oriented customer reporting. 

Our security engineers simulate the actions of a potential attacker, placing special focus on identifying vulnerabilities that cannot be found automatically by scanning tools. Our conclusive reportings based on industry best practices evaluate the target's information security level and make concrete recommendations for its improvement, ensuring the highest level of operative value for our customers. 

Lastly, our experience in the field translates into our regular activities in security research and contributions to the development of penetration testing standards inside the expert community.

## Security Audits
The wide field of independent security audits is where we combine all our strengths and skills from our long and diverse work experience in the security sector.

We both love to support IT teams with code security and infrastructure audits of customer applications where we help them introduce and harden a substainable security routine into their products, as well as conducting compliance audits in the scope of security certifications and due dilligence procedures in M&A scenarios where we perform a stock analysis and evaluation of the actual performance and effectiveness of Information Security operations of an organisation.

## Data Protection
If we're being honest, the GDPR isn't _new_ anymore and it is here to stay. Yet, it is still felt by many as complex and unwieldy.

We think that data privacy is, above all else, important. We officially serve as external Data Protection Officer for a diverse group of customers, where we translate relevant regulations to their individual business operations, enable them to make decisions in the field and sensibly utilize available budget.

Our individual strength lies in the interface between Data Privacy and Information Security and by this in our ability to effectively work with our customers on all legal, operational and technical levels.

## Additional fields of expertise
We also regularly work with our customers in the following fields:
* Thread Modelling and Risk Analysis
* Security Trainings
  * Secure Coding
  * Security in DevOps and IT operations
  * Trainings of employees as part of compliance requirements
* Red Teaming
* Emergency Response
