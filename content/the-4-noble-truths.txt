The Four Noble Truths:

1. Life is Memeing
Life is suffering and suffering is memeing, therefore life is memeing.
Comedy is intrinsic to tragedy. There is no comedy without tragedy and no tragedy without comedy.
To meme is to turn the tragedy of life into comedy.

2. The Origing of Memeing
Attachment causes suffering and suffering causes memeing. The path to memenlightment requires one to accept this fundamental truth.
Let go of your preconceptions of what fun is. A true Memer is not concerned wether his memes will be welcomed, because he knows that they are true.

3. The Cessation of Memeing
Once one understands that he can let go of attachment, suffering and memeing, he will understand the impermanence of humour and that mid-quality low-effort google images will suffice to convey humour to his statements, whatever they may be.

4. The Memenlightment Path
The path to memenlightment is not the understanding of the noble truths but the constant and mindfull practice thereof. Find comedy in the tragedy of life, accept it's duality and let go of it with a beautifully captioned jpeg.

Sincerly yours,
