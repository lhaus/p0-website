# Website Redesign 2018

The new Port Zero website. Minimalistic, Responsive, using Hugo, the static
content generator.

## Build

Building the website is as easy as running `build.sh`. You’ll need access
to `web01.port-ze.ro`, though. If you’re an external person, you’ll need to
update the build script to point to your web host after changing the content.

## Font

The font we use is ["Fira Sans"](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira). The [License](themes/portzero/static/fonts/LICENSE) is located in the directory `static/fonts`.

## Contributions

If you want to contribute, there are multiple ways to go about things:

Any typos and missing features should be communicated via [issues](/issues/new).
There is no fixed form for these; just tell us what should be fixed!

If you want to contribute the fixes yourself, fork the repository and add a 
[Pull Request](/compare). If you have any questions on how to get started,
feel free to post to the Website channel on the internal Port Zero chatroom—which
is only possible if you are part of the company—or contact Veit (@hellerve on
Github and Port Zero’s chat)!

We are grateful for all kinds of contributions and happy to answer any questions!
