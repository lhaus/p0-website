# Website Redesign 2018

The new Port Zero website. Minimalistic, Responsive, using Hugo, the static
content generator.

## Build

Building the website is as easy as running `build.sh`. You’ll need access
to `web01.port-ze.ro`, though. If you’re an external person, you’ll need to
update the build script to point to your web host after changing the content.

## Font

The font we use is ["Fira Sans"](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira). The [License](themes/portzero/static/fonts/LICENSE) is located in the directory `static/fonts`.

## License

The theme and styles associated with this website are subject to MIT. The
content and texts themselves are not subject to this license, and you are not
free to reuse them in any context unless given or explicit permission.
