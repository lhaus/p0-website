# Website Redesign 2018

The new Port Zero website. Minimalistic, Responsive, using Hugo, the static
content generator.

## Build

Building the website is as easy as running `build.sh`. Youâ€™ll need access
to `web-temp.port-zero.com`, though.

## Font
The font we use is ["Fira Sans"](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira). The [License](themes/portzero/static/fonts/LICENSE) is located in the directory `static/fonts`.
